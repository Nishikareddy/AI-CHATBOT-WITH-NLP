 DESCRIPTION:This project is a basic Python chatbot called WeatherBot that gives users the current weather information for any city they ask about. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather details and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to understand and extract the city name from user input. The chatbot starts by prompting the user to ask about the weather, such as “What’s the weather in Mumbai?” or “Tell me the weather for Delhi.” It uses word_tokenize() from NLTK to break the user's sentence into individual words and then looks for keywords like "in", "at", or "for" to identify which word comes after these—this is assumed to be the city name. Once the city is extracted, the chatbot sends a request to the OpenWeather API with the city name and retrieves the weather data in metric units (Celsius). It then formats the response to include the temperature, a short description of the weather (like “clear sky” or “light rain”), and the humidity level. If the city is not found or something goes wrong, the bot responds with a helpful error message. The chatbot continues running in a loop until the user types "bye", "exit", or "quit", at which point it politely ends the conversation. This project is useful for learning how to connect APIs with Python, how to process user input using basic NLP techniques, and how to build an interactive command-line chatbot. It can be further improved by handling more complex sentence structures or allowing multi-word city names like "New York". Overall, it’s a beginner-friendly project that shows how Python can be used to combine web data, NLP, and user interaction in a simple and fun way.
